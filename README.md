# Work Day Scheduler 

## How it works
When the user first opens up the Work Day Scheduler they can see the current day and date. They are then presented with input fields for each hour of their work day, 9-5pm. They can input any task or reminder in each text-field and then click the save button icon and the text is saved and stored in local storage. The hour/text block will appear green when it is a future hour from the current hour, blue if the hour/text block is in the past, and green if it is the present/ current hour.
